      <p>
        Strava and Garmin (and probably other applications) provide services
        that let you stream your real-time location (as long as you take your
        phone with you) while you exercise. I'm re-creating this service
        open-source. Why? Well, I thought these services were
        premium/paid/subscription-based. Turns out, they're free. So I have no
        excuse to make this. We do it anyway!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in self-hosting your own service like this, I'll
        have a full tutorial in the GitHub organization. It's not easy to set
        up, so good luck! (I'm kidding -- it's hard, but my documentation is
        good)
      </p>
      <p>
        Without futher ado, here's the service live. If you're viewing this site
        on a domain other than <code>justgood.dev</code> then you should put
        <code>justgood.dev/lantern</code> in the URL field below.
