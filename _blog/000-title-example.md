NOTE: `no` should be used for the `publish` keyword to hide the post

NOTE (from <https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/meta_data/#syntax>): If a line is indented by 4 or more spaces, that line is assumed to be an additional line of the value for the previous keyword. A keyword may have as many lines as desired.
