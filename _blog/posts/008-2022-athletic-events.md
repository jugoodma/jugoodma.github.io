# Racing in 2022

I completed a handful of events in 2022.

## Bike New York -- TD Five Boro Bike Tour

`2022-05-01`

it went well.
i got to the front, which was the move.
we were vibing at like 17mph.
no way i would have had a good time if i wasn't placed in the first wave (thank you Bloomberg for VIP access).
though, we finished maybe too early because the VIP lunch was not ready.
it sounded like anyone after the second wave got beaned with bicycle congestion and ferry congestion.

## NYRR -- RBC Brooklyn Half

`2022-05-21`

it went okay.
the weather was good enough that morning.
very wet.
though, it got hotter as the day progressed.
one runner actually died after crossing the finish line.

## NYRR -- Queens 10K

`2022-06-18`

it went well.
not my fastest 10k, but not my slowest.
the route was decent.
