# I Produced a New Song Every Week for One Year

And I still suck at producing.

Interesting to note that I was still doing a few side-projects at the beginning of the year, but that fizzled out by December 2022.

You can listen to each song on YouTube, from the June 5th 2022 start-date to the June 3rd 2023 end-date, in a convenient playlist <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-FvTMvbpA4&list=PLZGFthZiIBbXCq0B9t9ok61zFyvTGSeBf>.

I encourage you to at least read the descriptions of each video.

You can see from the YouTube playlist that I uploaded the first song on August 14th, 2022, yet I completed that song on June 11th, 2022.
I decided, seemingly about two months in, to upload each song online.
Apparently, I did this in an attempt to hold myself accountable to actually making each song.
I remember, at the start of the project, wondering if I'd be able to stay motivated until completion.
I wasn't sure if I wanted to quit, and I wasn't sure if I was just wasting my time.
Looking back, I feel that I probably would not change anything.
There were a few times when I felt burdened by this project -- life matters come up, and keeping to a consistent

Eventually, the entire album will be available, in the original rendered FLAC format, on Bandcamp <https://justingoodman.bandcamp.com/>.

Each song is labeled by the date I started the project -- every Sunday for 52 consecutive weeks.

## Rating Each Song

Let's do this through personally-dictated eras.
There's no rhyme or reason for these groupings.
I'll try to include some tid-bits about my life during each period in time.

### Vocal era

I started trying to use my voice more, in the spirit of experimentation and practice.

### Model era

This era somewhat summarizes how the rest of the project goes.
A weird eclectic mix of genres, but somehow I always come back to drum-and-bass.

- 2022-09-04

### Keys era

I tried quite a handful of new things with new keys.
I also started realizing that I should be doing some research before trying to make music in a genre I'm less familiar with (2022-09-25) (sorta).

### DEF-minor era

All of the songs here are in a minor key, which I found interesting.
ChatGPT also dropped during this period.
When I reached this point in the project, I realized I had no choice but to finish it out.

I moved away from blank videos in favor of screen-recording

### Sources/Meme era

When I started really doing research and copying down sources.
Somewhere around here, or the previous era, I watched <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFUdIZnI5o>.
Adam Neely discusses that perhaps we should implement a music citation system, as a solution to the music copyright problem.

### Elevator/Busy era

Book-ending this era with elevator beats.
I had a lot going on in my life during this span, so that could have affected my beat-making choices.
Plus -- not me forgetting how to mix in bass to a song...
