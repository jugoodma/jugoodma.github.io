# My Experience with Covid

Covid fucking sucks.
To anyone who says, _oh it's just a flu no big deal_, fuck you.
I hate you.
You're ugly and you have no friends.
It's just a flu?
When's the last time you've been seriously sick bro?
Do people just _forget_ that being sick sucks absolute donkey shit?

## Timeline

```
- 9-14 -- 9-16 DC travel for UMD career fair recruiting
- 9-16 Liz/roommate went out partying
- 9-17 Liz/roommate might feel sick
- 9-18 Bronx 10mi, Liz/roommate might feel sick
- next few days, on-off minor headache
- 9-24, 9-25 minor sore throat
- + 9-26 3am sore throat from satan's ass and very feverish, could not get back to sleep; tested positive for covid that day
- 9-27 still sick, feel awful, swallowing feels like eating glass; sleeping at night is sweaty but also cold
- 9-28 still sick, small signs of improvement but hard to tell -- it turns out that "improvement" was just because of ibuprofen; sweaty
- + 9-29 cancelling my plane tickets to go to Hawaii, sadge; still positive, but seeing improvements; throat hurts but i dont need pain killers; more mucus is getting in my throat
- 9-30 feeling much better, but my mental state isn't great; mild depression and some slowness in thought, not unlike how it feels the morning after doing weed
- + 10-1 better; occasional cough, nose feels a bit too dry, sore throat basically nonexistant
- + 10-5 tested positive, but the line is faint; basically all i have is the occasional cough now, because there's still some mucus in my throat
- 10-6 went back to relatively normal living
- 10-7 my grandmother tested positive for covid, but seems to be doing better than when I had it

Although it was quite spicy, the huge pot of chili I made before I got sick served me well.
I basically ate chili for most of my meals before/during my illness.
