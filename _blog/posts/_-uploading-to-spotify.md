# How I Uploaded My Song to Spotify

UPC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code> -- <https://my.gs1us.org/product/1024/gs1-company-prefix>

- only need one UPC per "release" (single, ep, lp, album) <https://artists.singlemusic.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059838794-Why-Are-UPC-and-ISRC-Required-In-Order-for-My-Sales-to-Report-> <https://hypeddit.com/news/upc-vs-isrc-which-one-gets-you-best-results-for-spotify-pre-saves/>
- we can get a single UPC for $30 (probably won't have my company as the company prefix, but i'll still be identified)

ISRC <https://usisrc.org/about/obtaining_code.html>

- one per track

The hardest part of this ordeal is becoming the music distributor.
It will be painful to figure out how to communicate with Spotify.
It will be even more painful to convince them you're a company worth their time.
