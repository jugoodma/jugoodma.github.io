    <h1>Is NYC actually cold?</h1>
<p>Yes.
I've officially lived through a winter.
The weather started getting better mid-to-late April.
It has been oscillating between warm and cold, but now -- mid May -- it's officially warm outside.
And with the warmth, of course, is the humidity.
Hooray!</p><hr>
