    <h1>Starting Real Life</h1>
    <p>
      So, what did I do between finishing college and starting "independence"
      and "adulthood"? Well, I put adulthood off for a year and earned a
      Master's degree. Okay okay, <em>now</em> what did I do? Here's a list of
      what I did:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>traveled</li>
    </ul>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>That's it?</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>yep.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>What I <em>actually</em> did</h2>
    <p>I traveled, a lot.</p>

      You can tell a lot about my sense of humor from the photos I took. We're
      all still kids at heart, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      There's still a global pandemic happening, so we couldn't do international
      travel. Fortunately, there are plenty of interesting places to see in the
      States.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start the summer, I almost immediately took a flight with my mom to
      Cali to see my brother and his girlfriend. Mom had no plans, she just
      needed a week to relax and be with her children. Zack and B were working
      while we were there. This culminated in a relaxing and uneventful trip. I
      joined Zack and B for (primarily) bike workouts (I did a run and a swim
      too). I played a lot of Terraria. This trip was exactly what I needed to
      recover from grad school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, I came home for a week and ordered some hiking boots and socks. Then
      my dad took me to College Park, and I met up with my roommates for a trip
      to Seattle. One of my roommates got a job in Seattle, so she moved out
      west. The girls wanted to see her, so I booked a flight with them and we
      planned a hiking trip. Of course, our now-resident-in-Seattle roommate
      merely moved in 4 days before us east-coast-kids showed up. Her place is
      awesome. We did 4 hikes (one in the snow, which was awesome --
      <strong>please wear sunscreen</strong>). Then her stuff arrived and we
      helped her move in. And then we flew back. Awesome trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of that trip, my former roommate and I planned a road trip
      to Yellowstone. He just got a job (rip job market, COVID sucks) so he
      wanted to do <em>something</em> before starting. So we rented a car and
      drove out west. Of the notable stops we made, The Corn Palace sticks out.
      I remembered watching some YouTube videos by Ted Nivison, so we
      <em>had</em> to check it out:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf-z8upa5Hk"
          >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf-z8upa5Hk</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbikVNDzAeg"
          >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbikVNDzAeg</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It was exactly as expected. It was everything I could have hoped for from
      Mitchell, South Dakota. I should note that in the middle of the country,
      COVID basically never happened. We'd see the occasional mask, but they
      were never required. On the coasts, masks are basically mandatory. Oh
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      We made a handful of stops.

    <p>After that, <em>to be continued</em>.</p>

    <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Was it worth it to set my job start date after summer? Well, for easy
      numbers, let's say my travels roughly cost me $3000. Had I started my job
      right out of school, I could have made ten times what I spent. But,
      happiness and lovely memories are worth infinitely many times more. I'd
      say it was worth it.
