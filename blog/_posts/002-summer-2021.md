# Starting Real Life

So, what did I do between finishing college and starting "independence" and "adulthood"?
Well, I put adulthood off for a year and earned a Master's degree.
Okay okay, _now_ what did I do?
Here's a list of what I did:

- traveled

...

That's it?
> yep.

## What I _actually_ did

I traveled, a lot.

| 08/20 -- 08/?? | Philly, Salisbury, W. MD | train, drive | |

You can tell a lot about my sense of humor from the photos I took.
We're all still kids at heart, right?

There's still a global pandemic happening, so we couldn't do international travel.
Fortunately, there are plenty of interesting places to see in the States.

To start the summer, I almost immediately took a flight with my mom to Cali to see my brother and his girlfriend.
Mom had no plans, she just needed a week to relax and be with her children.
Zack and B were working while we were there.
This culminated in a relaxing and uneventful trip.
I joined Zack and B for (primarily) bike workouts (I did a run and a swim too).
I played a lot of Terraria.
This trip was exactly what I needed to recover from grad school.

Next, I came home for a week and ordered some hiking boots and socks.
Then my dad took me to College Park, and I met up with my roommates for a trip to Seattle.
One of my roommates got a job in Seattle, so she moved out west.
The girls wanted to see her, so I booked a flight with them and we planned a hiking trip.
Of course, our now-resident-in-Seattle roommate merely moved in 4 days before us east-coast-kids showed up.
Her place is awesome.
We did 4 hikes (one in the snow, which was awesome -- **please wear sunscreen**).
Then her stuff arrived and we helped her move in.
And then we flew back.
Awesome trip.

Towards the end of that trip, my former roommate and I planned a road trip to Yellowstone.
He just got a job (rip job market, COVID sucks) so he wanted to do _something_ before starting.
So we rented a car and drove out west.
Of the notable stops we made, The Corn Palace sticks out.
I remembered watching some YouTube videos by Ted Nivison, so we _had_ to check it out:

It was exactly as expected.
It was everything I could have hoped for from Mitchell, South Dakota.
I should note that in the middle of the country, COVID basically never happened.
We'd see the occasional mask, but they were never required.
On the coasts, masks are basically mandatory.
Oh well.

We made a handful of stops.

After that, _to be continued_.

## Closing thoughts

Was it worth it to set my job start date after summer?
Well, for easy numbers, let's say my travels roughly cost me $3000.
Had I started my job right out of school, I could have made ten times what I spent.
But, happiness and lovely memories are worth infinitely many times more.
I'd say it was worth it.
