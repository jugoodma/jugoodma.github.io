# You Suck at Coding

Oh, hi, I didn't see you there.
You must be looking for the pharmacist.
They're right around the corner.
Oh? What's that? _Oh, you said coding, not codine._
My bad, I thought you were just following in my father's footsteps.
Yes right this way.

So you want to learn how to code, huh?
Or you've realized that your shit code isn't "compiling" or something?
You found a real live unicorn, in that silly little brain of yours, but your stupid programmer friend isn't going to "do all the work" while you do the ever so important job of handling the business side.
Or you just hate entering data into Excel by hand every day at your depressing 9-to-5 and you just want automation robots to take over society already.

Does this sound like you?
Well, the first step to "gettin gud" at programming is admitting you have a problem.
So, repeat after me --

> I suck at programming.
> It's too hard, and it makes no sense.
> This shit reminds me of high school algebra.
> But I'm ready now to forgive my past self and ascend to a god-level engineer.
> Here's to buzzed fizzes, logarithmic algorithms, and 99%-uptime microservices.

Let's get started.
